# 🧠 ML Basics – Hands-on Projects

Welcome to **ML Basics**, a collection of beginner-friendly Machine Learning projects implemented in **Python + Google Colab**.  
Each project focuses on applying fundamental ML algorithms to real-world datasets.


## 📂 Projects Included
- 📦 **Food Delivery Time Prediction**  
  Predicts delivery time using Linear Regression & Logistic Regression with evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE, Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve).

- 🚧 (More projects coming soon...)  


## 🚀 How to Use
1. Browse to any `.ipynb` notebook in this repo.  
2. Click the "Open in Colab" badge to run it instantly.  
3. Experiment, modify, and learn!  


## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Google Colab  


## 🎯 Goal
This repo is meant for:
- Students starting with Machine Learning  
- Developers brushing up ML basics  
- Anyone looking for simple, clean implementations of core algorithms  


## 📌 Notes
- All notebooks are self-contained and can be run on Colab without extra setup.  
- More projects will be added as I continue learning and experimenting.  


Made with ❤️ for learning ML.
